# Safe-Dosage-Calculation-Formula-for-Compound-Pharmaceuticals.
Safe Dosage Calculation Formula for Compound Pharmaceuticals.

We developed a formula for safely administering a pharmaceutical "drug or compounded" (chemical compound) to X(individual), we need to consider the molarity of the chemical compound and convert it into a dosage in milligrams. This dosage must also take into account the safety threshold over a specific period.

# Variables and Definitions:
M - Molarity of the chemical element (mol/L).
V - Volume of the solution to be administered (L)
MW - Molecular weight of the chemical element (g/mol)
Dsafe - Safe dosage in milligrams (mg)
Dmax - Maximum safe dosage in milligrams (mg)
T - Time period over which the dosages are administered (days)
N -  Number of doses per day
